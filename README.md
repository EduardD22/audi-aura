## Spotify Authorization
Currently, AudiAura is awaiting Spotify authorization for the Quota Extension. This means that I'm currently able to add a maximum of 25 users to the app. To try the app and go through the OAuth process, users must provide their Spotify email to be manually added to the application. If you are comfortable with this, please contact me with your Spotify email.

Alternatively, if you do not want to share your personal information, you can use the following test account to explore the app:

    Username: testGilbert49@gmail.com
    Password: testTest123!
